/*      FUNCTIONS
- The job of a function is to do something.
- WE can give our function different inst-
ructions in the form of statements
followed by semicolons;

- First thing we need while defining a
function, we need a return type.

- Like when they return a number to us,
the return type would be integer.

- But, when we need the function just to do
something, without returning us anything,
the return type would be void.

- RT FN PARAMETERS BODY OF FUNC

- Using a function is called calling it.

- C++ needs to be informed beforehand is
that we have created a function, in order
for the program to be able to call it.

- You can solve this problem either BY
putting our function before the main
function

- OR we can just put the RT FN
and parameters before the main function,
and parameters before the main function,
it is called FUNCTION PROTOTYPING.
