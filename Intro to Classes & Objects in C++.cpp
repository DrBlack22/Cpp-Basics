/*  INTRO TO CLASSES & OBJECTS

- Classes, a way of grouping function
and variables.

- In order to create function in C++,
we gotta be outside our main function.

- To create a class, use class with a small
c.

- Define class name after that.

- Add parentheses.

- Access specifier: Anything you put
after the specifier, can be accessed
accordingly.

- Class Declaration

- Class Body

- Function inside the class

- An object is how you access stuff
inside your class

- Objects make it easy to work with
multiple classes and function.

- So, to use function from a certain
class, you first type class's name
followed by the object name you
are intending to use.

- Now, to call that function, we'll
use object name, followed by a period,
followed by the function name and
parameter values.
